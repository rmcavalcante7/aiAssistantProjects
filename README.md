# AI Repository Operating System

Canonical guide for this repository.

This `README.md` consolidates the guidance that was previously split across:

- `AI_Repository_Guide_v2.md`
- `AI_Repository_Guide_v3.md`
- `AI_Repository_Guide_v3_improved.md`

Those files can be kept as historical drafts, but this README is the canonical human-facing guide from this point forward.

## What This Repository Is

This is not just a folder structure.

It is a controlled environment for AI-assisted engineering, designed to make an AI behave like a senior engineer working inside a structured system.

The repository is built around five core ideas:

- context replaces guesswork
- decisions prevent architectural drift
- runbooks standardize execution
- checklists enforce validation
- feedback drives continuous improvement

It is especially useful for:

- automation and RPA projects
- internal integration systems
- data-processing services
- reusable Python packages and internal SDKs

---

## Core Structure

### `.aiassistant/project_context/`

Purpose:

- holds the current understanding of the system
- contains the only active runtime context file

Main file:

- `CURRENT_CONTEXT.md`

Rule:

- this is the single source of truth for current system behavior

### `.aiassistant/decisions/`

Purpose:

- stores accepted architectural rules and constraints

Use it for:

- integration boundaries
- security rules
- dependency strategy
- long-lived trade-offs

### `.aiassistant/runbooks/`

Purpose:

- stores executable, repeatable procedures

Use it for:

- generating project documentation
- preparing packaging metadata
- publishing a Python package
- bootstrapping project context

### `.aiassistant/checklists/`

Purpose:

- validates that an output is safe and correct before completion

Use it for:

- release readiness
- environment validation
- delivery checks
- critical input validation

### `.aiassistant/rules/`

Purpose:

- defines how the repository and the AI should behave

Main files:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `CONTEXT_RULES.md`
- `CONTEXT_TEMPLATE.md`
- `REPOSITORY_GUIDELINES.md`

---

## Advanced Structure

### `.aiassistant/feedback/`

Captures real-world problems, pain points, bugs, and improvement opportunities.

### `.aiassistant/roadmap/`

Defines release-oriented planning, phases, and scope.

### `.aiassistant/specs/`

Defines how a complex or impactful change should be implemented before coding.

### `.aiassistant/prompts/`

Stores reusable, project-specific prompts for recurring tasks.

### `.aiassistant/templates/`

Provides reusable starter files for new artifacts.

Important:

- templates accelerate creation
- templates are not a source of truth
- every generated file must be adapted to the real project
- example files in this directory are illustrative only

---

## How The System Flows

Typical evolution flow:

1. `feedback/` identifies a problem or opportunity
2. `roadmap/` plans what should be built
3. `specs/` defines how a change should work
4. `decisions/` records binding architectural rules when needed
5. `runbooks/` execute repeatable procedures
6. `checklists/` validate correctness and safety
7. `project_context/CURRENT_CONTEXT.md` is updated to reflect reality

Not every project uses every layer every day, but the layers exist to keep the system consistent as it grows.

---

## Two Main Project Profiles

### 1. Operational Projects

Use this profile for:

- automations
- RPAs
- internal workers
- integration pipelines
- background jobs

Typical focus:

- operational flow
- entrypoints
- folders such as input, output, temp, logs, and errors
- credentials and execution environment

### 2. Product Projects

Use this profile for:

- Python libraries
- installable packages
- internal SDKs
- public repositories

Typical focus:

- installability
- public API
- packaging metadata
- release validation
- distribution and versioning

Important rule:

- packaging and publish runbooks are for product projects
- pure automations do not automatically need packaging or release runbooks

---

## Quick Start For A New Project

### If the project has no `CURRENT_CONTEXT.md`

Do not invent context.

Use `.aiassistant/runbooks/bootstrap-project-context.md` to gather the minimum real information required to create the first version of `CURRENT_CONTEXT.md`.

The initial goal is not to document everything.

The goal is to establish enough trustworthy context to stop the AI from guessing.

### After context exists

Use the repository incrementally:

- update context when the system changes
- create decisions when constraints become binding
- add runbooks when execution must be repeatable
- add checklists when failure is costly
- capture feedback when real pain points appear

---

## What Should Be General At Project Start

Some things are useful in almost every new project, even before the project becomes sophisticated:

- an initial `CURRENT_CONTEXT.md`
- a bootstrap checklist
- a decision template
- a spec template
- a roadmap template
- a prompt template for recurring tasks

That is why this repository now includes `.aiassistant/templates/` with starter artifacts that can be adapted per project.

There is also a filled example for a fictional automation project at:

- `.aiassistant/templates/current-context-example-automation.md`

Important:

- it is only a reference
- it is not active context
- it must not replace a real `CURRENT_CONTEXT.md`

---

## Recommended First Artifacts

For a fresh automation project:

- `CURRENT_CONTEXT.md`
- an operational `README.md`
- a bootstrap checklist
- one or more runbooks for execution-critical flows

For a fresh library or SDK:

- `CURRENT_CONTEXT.md`
- a product `README.md`
- `pyproject.toml`
- a release checklist
- publish runbook alignment

---

## Common Mistakes

- skipping context creation
- treating historical notes as active context
- changing behavior without recording a decision
- using runbooks as explanation instead of execution
- finishing work without a validation checklist
- mixing automation and package workflows without deciding the project type first

---

## Practical Rules For Humans And Agents

- read current context before coding when it exists
- do not override accepted decisions silently
- do not create parallel sources of truth
- do not invent missing architecture
- update context after meaningful system changes
- prefer explicit process over improvisation

---

## Current State Of This Repository

This repository is still a starter operating system, not a populated project instance.

That means:

- many directories currently contain guidance and templates rather than project-specific artifacts
- the value today is the process scaffolding
- real project context is expected to be created when this template is instantiated for an actual system

---

## Canonical References

If you are operating this repository, the main reference points are:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `.aiassistant/rules/AGENTS.md`
- `.aiassistant/rules/CONTEXT_RULES.md`
- `.aiassistant/rules/REPOSITORY_GUIDELINES.md`
- `.aiassistant/runbooks/`

---

## Final Goal

The goal is simple:

- make the AI behave with context
- make engineering decisions explicit
- make repeated work reproducible
- make validation unavoidable

In short, this repository exists to reduce guessing and increase operational rigor.
